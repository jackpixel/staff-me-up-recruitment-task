## From applicant

Hi, I would like to add a few words from myself. To accomplish this task, I decided to choose the minimum stack that allows you to quickly and conveniently complete it while maintaining simplicity. Hence I decided to pick Create React App and Typescript. It turned out that CSS Modules are parts of CRA so I also used them. I decided that using an external css-in-js library would be an overkill and increase the bundle size unnecessarily. If you have any questions this is my email: <jacek.maciejewski@venturedevs.com>.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
